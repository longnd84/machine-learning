    "2. Robust and often produce good results. \n",
    "3. Cover the most in the Udacity supervised machine learning support courses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections shall explain in more details the rationale of chosing these techniques for our data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Support vector machine (SVM) linear classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Rationale \n",
    "Support vector machine (SVM) is a simple yet effective linear classifier. Linear classifier is one of the most used classification techniques. It can also be used for multiple input variables/ features. \n",
    "SVM makes standard linear classifier even more robust for new test set by maximizing the margin between the feature values. \n",
    "Linear classification can be intuitively applied to our student data set by basically \"dividing\" the student into 2 categories (pass/fail) based on a combination of features/ characteristics (e.g. number of hours of studies, father/mother jobs). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths & weaknesses\n",
    "(taken from in Scikit learn documentation, with extra comments for our data set)\n",
    "General strengths of SVM are: \n",
    "1. Effective in high dimensional spaces (applicable for this data set)\n",
    "2. Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. \n",
    "3. Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (subpport vectors), so it is memory efficient (not very needed for the small data set) \n",
    "4. Versatile: different kernel functions can be provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of SVM are: \n",
    "1. If number of features is much greater than number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performance. In our data set we have a sufficient number of samples (~20 times more than number of features). \n",
    "2. SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are clculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Runtime\n",
    "SVM can be solved with quadratic programming, so i would guess the runtime is O(n^2). \n",

    "#### Description & Rationale \n",
    "Decision tree classification technique is most of the most simple yet widely used in supervised machine learning classification. Applying decision tree on the student intervention dataset can be intuitive and easy to explain to non-technical audience: we use each \"feature\" (characteristic) of students to subdivide them into smaller group.

    "4. Able to handle both numerical and categorical data (applicable for our dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: \n",
    "1. Overfitting (can be seen with high F1 score for train data, but low for test data)\n",
    "2. Can be unstable because of small variation in data (and small dataset). Can be mitigated using ensemble (gradient boosting). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Runtime\n",

    "\n",
    "### Description & Rationale\n",
    "The core idea behind gradient boosting classifier is turning multiple \"weak\" learners into \"strong\" learners through iterative steps. This can be very applicable in our data set: for example each weak learner in the student data set is picking one feature (e.g. number of hours spent on class, mother/father's education, wants to take higher education), do that iteratively to create a higher performing model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths & weaknesses\n",
    "(taken from Sci-learn documentation) \n",
    "Strengths: \n",
    "1. Natural handling of data of mixed data (numerical, categorical) (applicable for our data set)\n",
    "2. Predictive power (produce good results, which is always important)\n",

The F1 score for the \"without tuning\" SVM is higher than Gradient Boosting, but we believe  proper tuning (GridSearchCV), we believe we can get higher with Gradient Boosting (this algorithm is well-known for its predictive power).\n",
    "2. It is one of the most used and high performing models for both academics and machine learning practitioners. A foremost strength of Gradient Boosting is its predictive power (giving good results). \n",

    "Gradient boosting can be intuitively applied to the student data set because gradient boosting basically consists of doing the following steps repeatedly (until a certain tuned threshold): \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step of gradient boosting is creating a decision tree. This is analogous to taking simple student characteristics (e.g. number of hours studying, parents jobs...) to predict the student outcome (e.g. less than 10 hours of study per week means fail, more meaning pass). This often already gives a better result than by chance (50%). We can do the same of each of the feature, and apply a certain weighting factor (importance) to each of those.  Applying decision tree to student data is also very intuitive since it categorize the students into pass/fail category using a single feature (student characteristics). This is also very easy to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second step of gradient boosting is, not surprisingly \"boosting\". Based on the prediction we got wrong, and combined with other \"random\" data, we can continued making new prediction based on other student characteristics. Since we \"optimize\" on the data set we got wrong, this will continue to product better results. The key idea is based on the characterisics (decision tree) we decide in step (1), we can continuously adapt, and assign weighting factor to each of the feature (student characteristic) to arrive at a better student by each iteration. \n",
