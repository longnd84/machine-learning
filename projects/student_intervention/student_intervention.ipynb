    "SVM makes standard linear classifier even more robust for new test set by maximizing the margin between the feature values. \n",
    "Linear classification can be intuitively applied to our student data set by basically \"dividing\" the student into 2 categories (pass/fail) based on a combination of features/ characteristics (e.g. number of hours of studies, father/mother jobs). \n",

    "General strengths of SVM are: (1) Training is relatively easy: global optimum can always be found (with quadratic programming) (2) It scales well to high dementional data (multiple features)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the weaknesses of SVM is that it needs a good kernel function to be effective. \n",

Applying decision tree on the student intervention dataset can be intuitive and easy to explain to non-technical audience: we use each \"feature\" (characteristic) of students to subdivide them into smaller group. We can combine multiple features to subdivide them further.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The general strengths of decision tree are (1) easy to understand and use (2) easy to implement (3) commutationally cheap (calculatable using maximum gain theory). \n",
    "One of the weaknesses of decision tree is that it can overfit test data (can be seen with the result on student intervention data: high F1 score for train set but low for test set). \n",
    "#### Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "For each depth in the tree, the classification can be calculated using maximum information gain O(n). The tree would have on average log(n), so i would predict the runtime is O(n * log (n)). \n",

    "### (Ensemble) Gradient Boosting Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description & Rationale\n",
    "The core idea behind gradient boosting classifier is turning multiple \"weak\" learners into \"strong\" learners through iterative steps. This can be very applicable in our data set: for example each weak learner in the student data set is picking one feature (e.g. number of hours spent on class, mother/father's education, wants to take higher education), do that iteratively to create a higher performing model. \n",
    "One of the strengths of gradient boosting is its effectiveness: it is often cited as the most well performed model in machine learning classification. One of the weaknesses is its computational complexity (because it combines multiple classifiers). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Runtime\n",
    "Boosting will combine multiple classifiers step by step. So for boosting of SVM, the complexity would be k * O(n^2), where k is the number of steps (number of weak learners). For boosting of decision trees, the compexity would be k * O(n * log(n)).  \n",

    "3. It can be intuitively applied to the students data set because it basically allow us to improve our prediction base on some simple guesses (weak learners). \n",

    "2. Based on the prediction we got wrong, and combined with other \"random\" data, we can continued making new prediction based on other student characteristics. Since we \"optimize\" on the data set we got wrong, this will continue to product better results. \n",
